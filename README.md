# Gold-Rush
Gold rush was a video game that I made in Unity for CSE 374 (Intro To Game Design) at Miami University in the Spring of 2021. The game takes inspiration from Stardew Valley's underground areas with the main objective to be to get through all the floors in the game, while mining new ores and defeating harder enemies. 

Download for the game can be found [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/5hs1zqo2z94qlw7/Gold_Rush_v1.0.zip/file)
